    "# Artificial Intelligence CA1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is a form of intelligence exhibited by an entity to solve complex issues and these intelligence systems usually come in form of a computer or a machine. Artificial intelligence combines computer science and physiology intelligence which allows AI to achieve goals in the world. AI tries to achieve human-like thinking and behaviors in much less time than a human would take. Artificial intelligence is divided into sections, strong AI and weak AI. The theory behind strong AI is that machines can be made to think like humans. This means that in the future machines will have human-like intelligence and take the place of humans. Strong AI machines are emerging but are nowhere near creating enough to take over human intelligence at this current moment. The theory behind weak AI is that machines are not intelligent enough to think as well as humans. Weak AI takes on the principal that programs can be added to machines to make them think more humanly like. For example, in chess a human may feel as though the computer is making good moves but in fact the program is playing moves without thinking at all, making moves based on information based on the program developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different applications for AI. There are applications in every area of human activity. One of the biggest applications of AI would be in the gaming industry. The best example of this would be in chess. These machines are not as intelligent as humans, but they use brute force algorithms to scan hundreds of moves per second so it can determine a move. AI is also used in weather forecasting. Weather conditions are being predicted using neural networks. The neural networks by using past data which then is analyzed to predict the weather. Robots have become a big part of the work force in industry and are employed in jobs that a human would not work in. The robots also increase efficiency and they do not need to take breaks, which benefits business. AI is also used in the data mining industry. Data mining involves knowledge discovery in databases. It uses computer algorithms to discover patterns that are hidden and relationships that are unsuspected among elements in a dataset. Knowledge acquisition and representation are essential techniques within AI. Expert systems are machines that are used in AI to have total control over a specific area of interest. The systems use statistical data and analysis to solve problems by finding the solutions through a series of yes or no questions. There are three parts that make up an expert system: Knowledge base, inference engine and a rule or set of rules. The knowledge base stores all the information such as the data, rules, and the relationships. This is needed by the expert system to gain the expertise of the area. The inference engine is an information seeker which the engine retrieves from the knowledge base and then is presented with a query. That query gets analyzed and then responds with a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "##\n",
    "\n",
    "One of AI&#39;s major strengths is that the information that is gathered is based on facts rather than emotions. Even though humans try their hardest to make the correct decisions, our emotions can always affect our decision making in a negative way. Machines that have artificial intelligence do not need to sleep unlike humans who need to rest to function well for the next shift. It is a much easier task to train an artificial mind and give it the knowledge it requires to carry out the job. Furthermore, this also means that it is simpler to copy the same knowledge over to another artificial mind. It would take a lot longer for humans to learn the information through training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence can be lacking when it comes to the creativity of their responses for a user. The solutions to problems might be to straight forward and not what a user is looking for. AI can make decisions without using logic or reasoning which can be problematic. In some forms of AI, the machine does not know if there is no solution to a problem and will suggest possible solutions that are not relevant to the query. Solutions from the AI could be wrong due to a malfunction of the machine and if the AI cannot explain the reasoning behind its answer this can lead to problems if the user has a blind reliance on it. Major problems could occur if the AI&#39;s reasoning lacks common sense. If artificial intelligence is in the wrong hands, it could cause mass scale destruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommender system is used by developers as a tool to suggest or recommend a particular item based on the item a user may have searched for from a large list of items. Recommendation engines make it quick and easy for a user to get recommended items because the items will be tailored to the users&#39; preferences due to the power of AI. The AI recommendation engine is a big tool that is used in the e-commerce sector. This is down to the fact that the recommender makes businesses more profitable, allows them to make more sales and revenues in general. There are two types of recommender systems, content based, and collaborative based.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Based Recommender Systems –** The way that the content-based recommenders work is that the user provides the information for it to give the user the recommendation. Based on the users&#39; input that they provide, a profile for the user is generated. As the user makes more suggestions the user-based AI becomes more accurate. Information retrieval systems use the concepts of term frequency and inverse document frequency. Term frequency is the number of times a certain word is in a document and the inverse of document frequency based on the body of documents which is known as information document frequency. An example of IDF is if we search for &quot;the pink panther&quot; the recommender system knows that the word &quot;the&quot; will occur more frequently than &quot;pink&quot; or &quot;panther&quot; and so the AI knows that the important words in the search query are pink and panther.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Based Recommender Systems –** With collaborative recommender systems, it uses the similarities between the items and the user at the same time and that is how it is providing recommendations. This means that the recommender uses a filtering model that recommends an item to user B based on the similar interests of user A. This is known as serendipitous filtering. The system can automatically learn a user&#39;s interests without the need for engineering by hand for features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommender system is content based, and it recommends the user a list of movies and tv shows based on the movie or tv show title that they suggest in the system. It first displays the list of all movies or tv shows by retrieving the information from the dataset. To achieve this, we must add three libraries to our system. Pandas, NumPy and Sklearn. NumPy is used in python to perform mathematical calculations within arrays which adds structure to the application. Pandas is used in python for analysis and data manipulation. It is used when displaying numerical tables and adds operations and data structures. Sklearn is used in python for learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](RackMultipart20211031-4-ab8595_html_3139df75ab6073dd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I then write code to retrieve the dataset from my folder. I must put those columns within an array and display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](RackMultipart20211031-4-ab8595_html_5f7ba5174c11dfc9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next block of code, it will give the user a matrix where each word is represented in a column in the overview vocabulary and a movie or tv show is represented in each row. The reason that this is done is to reduce the words that occur more frequently. This helps the recommender system find movie titles that are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](RackMultipart20211031-4-ab8595_html_1155c63a7c37279e.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the cosine similarity method to work out the numeric amount of similarity between two or more tv shows or movies. I used &#39;title&#39; to distinguish between the different movies and tv shows since it easy for the user to see what the system will recommend based on the query and retrieving the title is easy for the recommender to calculate. I import the linear\\_kernel() library instead of using cosine\\_similarity() because it is faster at calculating the dot product. The linear kernel library is used to separate data in a linear fashion when dealing with a large dataset. This kernel is faster at displaying the data that is specified by the user than any other kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](RackMultipart20211031-4-ab8595_html_a294b21b3c4e4f13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line of code ensures that the recommender does not suggest the movie or tv show that has been queried. It achieves this by reverse mapping the movies and tv shows and the data frame indices. So, the movie and tv show index is identified in my metadata data frame and relates to the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](RackMultipart20211031-4-ab8595_html_3c2a37c62b6538a3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Get the index of a movie based on its title, get a particular movie or tv show with all movies or tv shows using the cosine similarity titles and retrieve the movie and tv show index and make sure it matches the title. Sort the movies and tv shows that relate to the similarity titles. Retrieve the titles of the top 10 movies or tv shows, get the indices of the movies and tv shows and retrieve the top 10 items that are similar.\n",
